# Results

This directory contains qualitative and quantitative results of the YOLOv8-based
automatic number plate detection model.

## Sample Predictions
The sample_predictions/ folder includes example images with bounding box predictions
generated by the trained model.

## Evaluation Metrics
Key evaluation metrics computed on the test dataset are summarized in metrics.txt.
The evaluation is based on IoU thresholding and mean IoU computation using a custom
evaluation script.
